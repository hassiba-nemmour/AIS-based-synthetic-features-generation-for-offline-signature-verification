# AIS-based-synthetic-features-generation-for-offline-signature-verification
This is a demonstration of an algorithm for synthetic features generation to reinforce offline signature verification systems.
The proposed algorithm is based on mechanisms of artificial immune systems.
The basic signature verification system employs the Multi-oriented local difference features and the Histogram of templates. Both descriptors are associated with SVM classifier that ensures the verification task.
Experiments of available codes were conducted on CEDAR dataset.
